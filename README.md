TrashCube

TrashCube is a Minecraft Mod that adds another way to deal with trash: convert them into blocks!
it's easy. just find a trashcube in strongholds or dungeons and insert your trash from top using hoppers or droppers.
and boom, a new Compressed Trash Block that you can dye and use as a decorative block!

The code can be complex, creepy or cancerous. so i would like anyone who reads the code to give 
feedbacks in issues. and help me make a better mod than before. k thx
